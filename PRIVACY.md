> **TL;DR:** We strongly support users' right to privacy. QR Share Pro doesn't collect or sell your data to anyone. Everything is saved and processed on device.

1. We don't collect anything.
2. QR Share Pro stores all data on-device.
3. Website favicons are queried through [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). (***Opt-out:* QR Share Pro (new QR code form) > top right Gear icon > toggle "Show Website Favicons"**)
4. Scanned QR code locations are stored on-device. [Apple Maps](https://apple.com/legal/privacy) displays the saved coordinates onto a map. (***Opt-out:* Settings > QR Share Pro > Location**)
