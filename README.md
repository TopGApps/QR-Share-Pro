## About

**TL;DR: The only QR code app on the store that cares about your privacy. No creepy data selling, 100% free, no ads, no in-app purchases. [Learn more ‚Üí](PRIVACY.md)**

QR Share Pro is the next-generation way to scan, share, and generate QR codes. We offer a quick method to generate codes from anywhere on your phone by simply clicking on the share menu and tapping our icon. You will be presented with a beautiful QR code that is as versatile as it looks. It is even added to your history tab after you generate it.

QR Share Pro also features a versatile scanning function that safely unshortens URLs in QR Codes. Most QR codes contain tracking links such as [https://qrco.de](https://qrco.de), which actually redirect you to the real site, typically after collecting data such as your IP address and other metrics. By unshortening these links, we show you exactly where the QR code is actually taking you, protecting you from phishing scams. We also eliminate URL trackers (such as google analytics) from URLs before unshortening to provide users the maximum privacy.

The history feature is also very useful. Every time you create or scan a QR code using the app, we promptly add it to your history. You can even access the location where you scanned the code, which can be extremely helpful.

The best part about all of this? We take the best efforts to make sure your information stays private on-device, so nobody else knows what you're doing. [Learn more ‚Üí](PRIVACY.md)
