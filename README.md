## App Features

**TL;DR: The only QR code app on the store that cares about your privacy. No creepy data selling AND 100% free (no ads or in-app purchases). [Learn more →](PRIVACY.md)**

### 📸 Safely Scan QR Codes

Most QR codes contain tracking links such as [https://qrco.de](https://qrco.de), which redirects you to the real site, typically after collecting data such as your IP address and other metrics. By un-shortening these links, we show you exactly where the QR code is actually taking you, protecting you from phishing scams. We also eliminate URL trackers (such as Google Analytics) from URLs before un-shortening to provide users the maximum privacy.

### 🔨 Generate QR Codes

Quickly generate codes from anywhere on your phone by simply clicking on the share menu and tapping our icon. You will be presented with a beautiful QR code that is as versatile as it looks.

### 📜 History

Every time you create or scan a QR code using the app, we promptly add it to your History. You can even see where you scanned the code, which can be extremely helpful.

### 🔒 Privacy

The best part about all of this? We take the best efforts to make sure your information stays private on-device, so nobody else knows what you're doing. [Learn more →](PRIVACY.md)

Not private enough for you? By all means, please submit a PR or an issue describing how QR Share Pro can take even more precautions to keep our users safe!
